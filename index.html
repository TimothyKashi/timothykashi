      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I am a senior at the University of Nevada, Reno pursuing a career in
         the computer software industry. As a computer science and engineering
         major and mathematics minor, I find interest in machine learning, test
         automation, and web development.

         Furthermore, I have taken several computer science courses, such as
         data structures, principles of operating systems, and analysis of
         algorithms. I would like to apply these skills that I have learned to
         solve real-world problems.
